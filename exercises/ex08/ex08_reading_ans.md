## Intro to GLib, Reading Answers

1) Glib is separated from GTK+ because it doesn't used for GUIs, and it is developed by GNOME. It provides advanced data structures and implements functions that provide threads, thread programming and more. It also provides message passing capabilities.

2) Glib has more consistent utility functions than those in the core C features. It is
not as restricted as traditional programming in C because it can work over multiple operating
systems. As mentioned before, it includes features such as advanced data structures, threading, and more. However, it falls short of being useful for GUIs.
